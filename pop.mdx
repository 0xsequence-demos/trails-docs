## Overview

The Payment Orchestration Protocol is an intent-based, chain-abstracted payments architecture that enables lightning fast, simplified payments from any wallet seamlessly with **unified user liquidity**. In contrast to typical cross-chain infrastructure, the protocol sources liquidity and aggregates all user balances for every token across every chain in a user's wallet as options for any payment execution on a destination chain such as a swap, deposit, transfer, or trade.

## Key Features

### Universal User Liquidity
- Aggregates all user balances across every token and chain as payment options.
- Enables payments using any combination of available assets and chains, i.e., use 30 USDC from Optimism + Base to purchase NFT for 60 USDC.
- Leveraging existing liquidity infrastructure such as DEX's, bridges, or aggregators, we support a vast array of tokens and chains.

### Seamless Payments
- Payments occur in a single confirmation with any wallet, regardless if it's an EOA, account abstraction wallet, or EIP-7702 enabled.
- Developers simply specify payment intent (e.g., "purchase NFT #123 with 30 USDC") for a user to confirm.
- Built-in indexing to automatically return user's wallet data, transaction history, etc.

### Blazing Fast
- Fast from anywhere, even across chains using our intent-based architecture & relayer infrastructure.
- Protocol intelligently detects optimal route for payment fulfillment.




## Integration Options

### Lightweight SDK
- **Built-in UI**: Ready-to-use interface with customizable branding
- **API Integration**: Headless implementation for custom UX
- **Plug-and-play**: Minimal setup required for developers


## Architecture Benefits

### For Users
- **Seamless UX**: No manual bridging or token swapping required
- **Flexible Payments**: Use any combination of tokens/chains for transactions
- **Aggregated Balance View**: Unified wallet balance across all chains
- **Optimal Routing**: Automatic selection of best payment path

### For Developers
- **Easy Integration**: Lightweight SDK with minimal complexity
- **Customizable**: Branding options and flexible UI components
- **Rapid Development**: Plug-and-play functionality
- **Enhanced Monetization**: Streamlined payment flows for every use case - swaps, deposits, mints, or withdrawals.

### For Chains
- **Increased User Acquisition**: Seamless onboarding without native token requirements
- **Higher TVL**: Increased capital inflow through frictionless UX
- **Greater Transaction Volume**: Reduced friction encourages more activity

## How AnyPay Stacks up

The Payment Orchestration Protocol is complementary to existing cross-chain infrastructure by leveraging various fillers & solvers as well as various DEX's and bridges for maximum liquidity across a wide variety of tokens:

## Technical Implementation

The protocol operates through:

1. **Intent Recognition**: Parse user payment requests
2. **Balance Aggregation**: Collect available assets across all chains
3. **Route Optimization**: Calculate optimal payment paths
4. **Execution Coordination**: Orchestrate cross-chain transactions
5. **Settlement Verification**: Ensure successful payment completion

This architecture enables developers to build sophisticated payment experiences while abstracting the underlying complexity of multi-chain operations.
