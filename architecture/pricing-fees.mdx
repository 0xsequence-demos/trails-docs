## Fee Model

The protocol is free to integrate for any app. 

Trails has a fee model competitive with the market which consists of a percentage of the transaction volume exchanged when orchestrating a transaction paid by the user when a bridge or swap is part of the orchestration. Notably, these are not static and scale down significantly with the value transacted, therefore higher transaction volume amounts will result in less fees for the user.
