AnyPay's Payment Orchestration Protocol simplifies cross-chain transactions through an intelligent 5-step process that handles the complexity of multi-chain operations behind the scenes.

## Overview

The AnyPay protocol automatically determines the optimal path for cross-chain payments, whether it's a simple single-chain transaction or a complex multi-step orchestration involving swaps, bridges, and executions across different blockchains.

## Step-by-Step Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Intent">
    **Create a payment transaction for any chain in any token**
    
    Users begin by defining their payment intent - whether it's a mint, deposit, swap, or any other transaction type. This intent can be created for any supported blockchain using any supported token.

  </Step>

  <Step title="AnyPay Inspects">
    **Determines if orchestration is needed**
    
    AnyPay's intelligent inspection engine analyzes the defined intent to determine the optimal execution path:

    - **Pass Through**: If the transaction can succeed without orchestration (same chain, sufficient balance, etc.), it passes through directly
    - **Continue Orchestrating**: If cross-chain operations or token swaps are needed, the system continues to the orchestration process

    <Note>
      This inspection happens in milliseconds and considers factors like:
      - Available token balances
      - Gas requirements
      - Chain compatibility
      - Protocol availability
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Route">
    **AnyPay suggests optimal routing options**
    
    When orchestration is required, AnyPay analyzes available routes across chains and presents the optimal options:

    - **Automated Suggestions**: The system suggests the most efficient token and chain combinations
    - **User Customization**: Users can review and customize the suggested route
    - **Cost Analysis**: Each route option includes gas costs, fees, and estimated execution time

    <Tip>
      Users maintain full control over the routing decision while benefiting from AnyPay's optimization algorithms.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Orchestrate Payment">
    **Intelligently combine operations for the selected route**
    
    Once the route is confirmed, AnyPay orchestrates the necessary operations:

    - **Swap Operations**: Convert tokens to the required format
    - **Bridge Transactions**: Move assets between chains when needed
    - **Execution Preparation**: Set up the final transaction parameters

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Transaction">
    **User confirms and completes the end-to-end flow**
    
    The final step puts control back in the user's hands:

    - **Wallet Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms the transaction through their connected wallet
    - **End-to-End Execution**: AnyPay executes the complete orchestrated flow
    - **Transaction Completion**: The system handles all intermediate steps and delivers the final result

    <Info>
      Users only need to sign once, but AnyPay may execute multiple transactions behind the scenes to complete the orchestrated payment.

  </Step>

## Technical Architecture

The AnyPay protocol leverages several key components:

- **Intent Recognition**: Parses and understands user payment intentions
- **Route Optimization**: Calculates optimal paths across supported chains
- **Protocol Integration**: Interfaces with DEXs, bridges, and other protocols
- **Transaction Orchestration**: Coordinates complex multi-step operations
- **Execution Engine**: Handles the actual transaction execution and monitoring
