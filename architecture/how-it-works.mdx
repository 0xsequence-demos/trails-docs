Trails offers developers a solution to enable 1-click crypto experiences via any wallet, token and chain. Trails aims to make "Ethereum work as one" by solving the widespread chain and liquidity fragmentation problems by providing a multi-chain transaction orchestration layer on top of wallets that unifies all chains and automates token routing, all with a single end-user confirmation (1-click).

## Overview

Trails automatically determines the optimal path for cross-chain transaction execution, whether it's a simple single-chain transaction or a complex multi-step orchestration involving swaps, bridges, and executions across different blockchains.

Trails is built on the [Sequence](https://docs.sequence.xyz) v3 stack combining the powers of account abstraction, real-time indexing, and gasless transaction execution into an intent-powered chain abstraction solution. Trails is designed to work with any wallet, including a simple EOA wallet, a powerful smart wallet or an in-app embedded wallet (ie. MetaMask, Wallet Connect, Privy, Coinbase Smart Wallet, ...). For more details under-the-hood, please see the [protocol architecture](/architecture/protocol) section.

The protocol is designed to be extensible, with plans to support non-EVM chains in the future.

## Step-by-Step Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Intent">
    **Create a payment transaction for any chain in any token**
    
    Users begin by defining their payment intent - whether it's a mint, deposit, swap, or any other transaction type. This intent can be created for any supported blockchain using any supported token.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Trails Inspects">
    **Determines if orchestration is needed**
    
    Trails's intelligent orchestration engine analyzes the defined intent to determine the optimal execution path:

    - **Pass Through**: If the transaction can succeed without orchestration (same chain, sufficient balance, etc.), it passes through directly
    - **Continue Orchestrating**: If cross-chain operations or token swaps are needed, the system continues to the orchestration process

    <Note>
      This inspection happens in milliseconds and considers factors like:
      - Available token balances
      - Gas requirements
      - Chain compatibility
      - Protocol availability
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Route">
    **Trails suggests optimal routing options**
    
    When orchestration is required, Trails analyzes available routes across chains and presents the optimal options:

    - **Automated Suggestions**: The system suggests the most efficient token and chain combinations
    - **User Customization**: Users can review and customize the suggested route
    - **Cost Analysis**: Each route option includes gas costs, fees, and estimated execution time

    <Tip>
      Users maintain full control over the routing decision while benefiting from Trails's optimization algorithms.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Orchestrate Payment">
    **Intelligently combine operations for the selected route**
    
    Once the route is confirmed, Trails orchestrates the necessary operations:

    - **Swap Operations**: Convert tokens to the required format
    - **Bridge Transactions**: Move assets between chains when needed
    - **Execution Preparation**: Set up the final transaction parameters

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Transaction">
    **User confirms and completes the end-to-end flow**
    
    The final step puts control back in the user's hands:

    - **Wallet Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms the transaction through their connected wallet
    - **End-to-End Execution**: Trails executes the complete orchestrated flow
    - **Transaction Completion**: The system handles all intermediate steps and delivers the final result

    <Info>
      Users only need to sign once, but Trails may execute multiple transactions behind the scenes to complete the orchestrated payment.

  </Step>

## Technical Architecture

The Trails protocol leverages several key components:

- **Intent Recognition**: Parses and understands user payment intentions
- **Route Optimization**: Calculates optimal paths across supported chains
- **Protocol Integration**: Interfaces with DEXs, bridges, and other protocols
- **Transaction Orchestration**: Coordinates complex multi-step operations
- **Execution Engine**: Handles the actual transaction execution and monitoring
