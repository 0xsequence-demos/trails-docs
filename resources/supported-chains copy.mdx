## Networks & Fees

The protocol is free to integrate for any app. The pricing model of Trails consists of a percentage of the transaction volume exchanged when orchestrating a transaction from the user. Notably, higher transaction amounts will result in significantly reduced fees.

More chains are being added all the time. If you'd like to see a specific chain added, please get in touch!


## Supported Bridges & Fillers

We are able to tap into virtually any solver, filler, or bridge system as well as underlying liquidity sources like DEX's, aggregators, and more. Currently we are integrated with Relay, LiFi, and CCTPv2 but please contact us if you would like your own liquidity source added.
