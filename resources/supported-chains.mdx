## Networks & Fees

The protocol is free to integrate for any app. The fee model of the Trails protocol consists of a fee-sharing model where a percentage of any swap or payment transactions from the user is split between the Trails Protocol and the app developer.

More chains are being added all the time. If you'd like to see a specific chain added, please get in touch!


## Supported Bridges & Fillers

We are able to tap into virtually any solver or filler system as well as underlying liquidity sources. Currently we are integrated with Relay, LiFi, and CCTPv2 but if you're interested in integrating your own - please get in touch!
