## Pay Gas with non-native tokens

Trails is able to support paying gas in any permit-compatible (EIP-2612) token which includes popular options and many stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. 

The user will be prompted initially with an approval for the token and every subsequent transaction will be a single confirmation.

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export const PayWithAnyToken = () => (
  <TrailsWidget
    mode="pay"
    gasless={true}
    toAddress="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
    toAmount="1"
    toChainId={8453} // Base
    toToken="USDC"
  >
    <button>Pay with USDC on Base</button>
  </TrailsWidget>
)
```
