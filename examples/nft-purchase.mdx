## Cross-Chain & Token NFT Purchasing

AnyPay revolutionizes NFT purchasing by enabling users to buy NFTs on any chain using tokens from any supported network. Whether your users hold ETH on Mainnet but want to purchase an NFT on Polygon, or have USDC on Arbitrum but want to buy on Base, AnyPay seamlessly handles the cross-chain bridging and token swapping in a single transaction.

## Enhanced User Experience for NFT Marketplaces

By integrating AnyPay, NFT marketplacescan dramatically reduce friction for buyers who would otherwise need to:
- Bridge tokens manually to the target chain
- Swap to the required payment token
- Pay multiple gas fees across different networks
- Wait for bridge confirmations

Instead, users can purchase NFTs directly using their existing token balances from any supported chain.

## Example Implementation NFT Purchase

### Purchasing an NFT on Polygon with ETH from Mainnet

This example shows how to use the AnyPay widget to purchase an NFT on Polygon, paying with ETH from Ethereum Mainnet:

<CodeGroup>

```tsx NFTPurchase.tsx
import { AnyPayWidget } from '@0xsequence/anypay-sdk/widget'
import { encodeFunctionData } from 'viem'
import { nftABI } from './abi.ts'

export const CrossChainNFTPurchase = () => {
  // NFT contract address on Arbitrum
  const NFT_CONTRACT = "0xAA3df3c86EdB6aA4D03b75092b4dd0b99515EC83"
  
  // NFT purchase calldata
  const purchaseCalldata = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: nftABI,
    functionName: 'mint',
    args: [
      "0x97c4a952b46becad0663f76357d3776ba11566e1", // recipient address
    ],
  })

  return (
    <AnyPayWidget
      toAddress={NFT_CONTRACT}
      toAmount="0.00002"
      toChainId={42161} // Arbitrum
      toToken="ETH"
      toCalldata={purchaseCalldata}
      renderInline={true}
      theme="auto"
      walletOptions={[]}
    />
  )
}
```

```typescript abi.ts
export const nftABI = [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "mint",
    stateMutability: "payable",
    inputs: [
      { name: "to", type: "address" },
    ],
    outputs: [],
  },
] as const
```

</CodeGroup>

## Integration Benefits

- **Unified Liquidity**: Users can spend tokens from any supported chain
- **Reduced Friction**: Eliminate manual bridging and swapping steps
- **Better Conversion**: Higher purchase completion rates
- **Gas Optimization**: Single transaction instead of multiple bridge/swap transactions
- **Multi-Token Support**: Accept payments in various tokens while receiving your preferred asset
