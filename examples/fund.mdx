## Funding with Trails

Trails seamlessly enables users to deposit funds into your chain, app, or protocol with optimized UX flows and native integrations with multiple liquidity sources to optimize routes.

## Depositing USDC into Base

<CodeGroup>

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export const BaseDeposit = () => {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      mode="fund"
      toAddress="0x97c4A952b46bEcaD0663f76357d3776ba11566E1" // User Address
      toChainId={8453}
      toToken="USDC"
      theme="auto"
    />
  )
}
```
