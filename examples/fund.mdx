## Funding with Trails

Trails seamlessly enables users to deposit funds into your chain, app, or protocol with optimized UX flows and native integrations with multiple liquidity sources to optimize routes for low-slippage. Users can fund from any token they hold across any supported chain, eliminating the need for manual bridging and swapping.

## Enhanced Funding Experience

Traditional funding flows require users to:
- Bridge tokens manually to the target chain
- Swap to the required deposit token
- Pay multiple gas fees across different networks
- Wait for bridge confirmations
- Navigate complex DeFi interfaces

Trails simplifies this by allowing users to deposit funds using any token from any supported chain in a single transaction, automatically handling all bridging, swapping, routing, and execution logic.

## Use Cases
- Deposit into a perpetual exchange for leverage trading
- Bootstrap liquidity for lending protocols
- Add funds to your balance on an application with crypto support.
- Fund staking contracts
- Onboard users to new chains seamlessly by directly calling functions from any origin chain

## Examples

### Depositing USDC into Base

This example shows how to use the Trails widget to enable a user to deposit into a chain with any token, in this case USDC on Base:

<CodeGroup>

```tsx SimpleDeposit.tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export const BaseDeposit = () => {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      mode="fund"
      toAddress="0x..." // User Address
      toChainId={8453} // Base
      toToken="USDC"
      toAmount="100" // 100 USDC
      theme="auto"
    />
  )
}
```
</CodeGroup>
