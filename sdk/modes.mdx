description: Overview of Pay and Fund modes
---

The Trails widget supports two modes optimized for different use cases, each using a different trade type approach.

## Mode Overview

### Pay Mode - Exact Output
- **Use Case**: Payment scenarios where you need a specific amount delivered
- **Trade Type**: Exact Output (recipient gets exactly what you specify)
- **Best For**: NFT purchases, fixed-price transactions, e-commerce payments
- **Logic**: User pays whatever is needed → Recipient gets exact `toAmount`

### Fund Mode - Exact Input  
- **Use Case**: Funding scenarios where users want to spend a specific amount
- **Trade Type**: Exact Input (user spends exactly what you specify)
- **Best For**: Protocol deposits, chain funding, investment scenarios
- **Logic**: User spends exact `toAmount` → Destination gets whatever results

## Simple Way to Think About It

```
Fund = exact_input trade type
Pay = exact_output trade type
```

## When to Use Each Mode

**Use Pay Mode when:**
- Selling products with fixed prices
- NFT marketplaces with set prices
- Subscription payments
- Any scenario where the recipient must receive an exact amount

**Use Fund Mode when:**
- Users want to deposit a specific budget amount
- Funding protocols where the exact input matters
- Investment scenarios where users allocate specific amounts
- Chain onboarding where users want to spend a set amount

## Configuration

Both modes require the same core parameters:
- `toAddress`: Destination address
- `toAmount`: Amount (input for Fund, output for Pay)
- `toChainId`: Destination chain
- `toToken`: Destination token
