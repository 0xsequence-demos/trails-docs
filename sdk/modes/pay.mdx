title: Pay
description: Send & swap flow to a recipient
---

Pay mode is optimized for payment use cases such as cross-chain swaps, stablecoin trades, NFT & ecommerce purchases, and general transactions. It enables users to pay using any token from any supported chain, and is ideal when you know the exact amount the recipient should receive.

## Trade Type: Exact Output

Pay mode uses an **exact_output** trade, meaning:
- You specify the exact amount the recipient will receive (`toAmount`)
- The user pays whatever amount is needed from their available tokens
- Perfect for fixed-price purchases (NFTs, swaps, functions with specific token amounts)

## Basic Example

```tsx
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

export function PayExample() {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      mode="pay"
      toAddress="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
      toAmount="10" 
      toChainId={8453}
      toToken="USDC"
      renderInline
    />
  )
}
```
