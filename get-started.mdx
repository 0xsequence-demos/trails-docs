To install on your own application:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```shell pnpm
    pnpm i 0xtrails
    ```
    ```shell npm
    npm install --save 0xtrails
    ```
    ```shell yarn
    yarn add 0xtrails
    ```
    ```shell bun
    bun add 0xtrails
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Import and Use the Widget">
    Add the widget to your React application, for example send 1 USDC cross-chain to a recipient on Base.

    ```typescript
    import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails/widget'

    export const App = () => {
      return (
        <TrailsWidget
          toAddress="0x97c4A952b46bEcaD0663f76357d3776ba11566E1"
          toAmount="1" 
          toChainId={8453}
          toToken="USDC"
        />
      )
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Next steps

 - [Pay](@use-cases/pay): Buy NFTs, RWAs, or any asset using any token from any chain; Trails aggregates balances and handles bridging, swapping, and execution.
 - [Swap](@use-cases/swap): Cross-chain token swaps in a single confirmation with unified liquidity and optimal routingâ€”no manual bridging or DEX hopping.
 - [Fund](@use-cases/fund): Deposit into a chain, app, or protocol from any token on any chain in one flow; Trails optimizes routes and handles swaps/bridges.
 - [Earn](@use-cases/earn): Deposit into vaults/pools (e.g., Aave) with automatic swap/bridge to the required asset; confirm once and start earning.

- [Configuration](/sdk/configuration): Full list of variables to customize Trails including different modes, theming, enabling gasless transactions, events, and quote providers.


## Script Import

While we recommend using the React component, you can also embed via a script tag in a non-React site.

```html
<div id="trails"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/0xtrails@latest/dist/umd/trails.min.js"></script>
<script>
  TrailsWidget.render(document.getElementById('trails'), {
    toAddress: '0x...',
    toAmount: '0.1',
    toChainId: 8453,
    toToken: '0xUSDC...'
  })
</script>
```
