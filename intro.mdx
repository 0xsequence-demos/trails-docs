title: What is Trails
description: Intent powered multichain transaction rails to pay, swap, fund, or earn in 1-click with any wallet, token or chain.
---


## Overview

Trails is a multi-chain orchestration protocol that enables 1-click simplified and fast transactions from any wallet seamlessly with unified user liquidity across all chains.
In contrast to typical cross-chain offerings, Trails sources liquidity and aggregates all user balances for every token across every chain in a user's wallet
as options for any transaction (ie. payment) on a destination chain. Trails is architected as a trustless system that
works on top of existing bridging, filler, or solver infrastructure. Trails is free to integrate and is optimized for a variety of use cases, for example:

- **[Pay](/examples/pay)**: Enable cross-chain, 1-click payments with any token for ecommerce platforms, NFT marketplaces, real-world asset purchases, and minimal-slippage stablecoin transactions.
- **[Swap](/examples/swap)**: Embed low-latency, highly liquid cross-chain token swaps for DeFi applications, portfolio management tools, and trading platforms
- **[Fund](/examples/fund)**: Maximize TVL and transaction velocity through fully brandable funding widgets for protocol deposits, chain onboarding, and liquidity provisioning
- **[Earn](/examples/earn)**: Streamline DeFi yield opportunities by enabling deposits into tokenized vaults, lending pools, and yield strategies from any token on any chain


## Key Features

### 1-click transactions
- Payments occur in a single confirmation with any wallet, regardless if it's an EOA, account abstraction wallet, or EIP-7702 enabled.
- Developers simply specify payment intent (e.g., "purchase NFT #123 with 30 USDC") for a user to confirm.
- Built-in multichain real-time indexing to automatically return user's wallet balances & prices. No additional vendor license required.

### Universal User Liquidity
- Aggregates all user balances across every token and chain as payment options.
- Leveraging existing liquidity infrastructure such as DEX's, bridges, or aggregators, we support a vast array of tokens and chains.

### Blazing Fast
- Fast from anywhere, even with payments across chains using our intent-based architecture & relayer infrastructure.
- Protocol intelligently detects optimal route for payment fulfillment.

### Scalable
- Trails can leverage virtually any existing cross-chain or liquidity infrastructure, including bridges, aggregators, and more.
- Relayer & Indexing infrastructure is lightweight and easily deployable to new chains.

## How Trails Works

1. **Define Intent (App)**: Create a payment transaction (mint, deposit, swap, etc) for any chain in any token.
2. **Trails Inspects (Trails SDK)**: Can this succeed with the assets held on current chain? Yes = Pass through. No = Continue Orchestration.
3. **Select Route (User)**: Trails presents an aggregated balance of the user's assets across all chains for the user to select from.
4. **Orchestrate Transaction (Trails SDK)**: Intelligently combines and optimizes swap + bridge + execute for the selected route to fulfill the transaction.
5. **Execute Transaction (Trails Intents)**: User confirms transaction via their wallet which executes the end to end to flow for the selected payment.

This architecture enables developers to build sophisticated transaction experiences while abstracting the underlying complexity of multichain operations. All you have to do is specify what transaction and any payment options to execute
on a destination chain.

### Working with Trails

The Trails is complementary to existing cross-chain infrastructure it is highly pluggable and leverages various fillers, solvers, DEX's, and bridges for maximum liquidity and low-slippage across a wide variety of tokens and routes. In short, Trails enhances the flow of funds for underlying infrastructure.

Trails supports any wallets including: EOA wallets such as MetaMask, smart wallets like Coinbase Smart Wallet, and embedded wallets like Privy. Trails supports any EVM-compatible chain
and does not require EIP-7702 enabled wallets. For more information please read our [architecture section](/architecture/how-it-works).

## Who Built Trails?

Trails is built by [Sequence](https://sequence.xyz), the creators of the all-in-one developer platform for web3.

## Integration

Simply add our SDK as a customizable, embeddable widget to your client-side application and specify the transaction you want to make:


<CodeGroup>
```shell pnpm
pnpm i 0xtrails
```
```shell npm
npm install --save 0xtrails
```
```shell yarn
yarn add 0xtrails
```
```shell bun
bun add 0xtrails
```
</CodeGroup>


```ts
import { TrailsWidget } from '0xtrails'

// Execute a cross-chain payment to a recipient.
export const CrossChainPayment = () => {
  return (
    <TrailsWidget
      toAddress="0x..." // recipient wallet address
      toAmount="0.1"
      toChainId={8453} // Base
      toToken="USDC"
    >
      <button className="custom-button-styles">
        Pay with Crypto
      </button>
    </TrailsWidget>
  )
}
```
