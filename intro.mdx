title: What is Trails
description: Intent-powered multi-chain transaction rails to orchestrate 1-click payments and contract calls with any wallet, token or chain.
---


## Overview

Trails is a multi-chain orchestration protocol that enables 1-click simplified and fast transactions from any wallet seamlessly with unified user liquidity across all chains.
In contrast to typical cross-chain offerings, Trails sources liquidity and aggregates all user balances for every token across every chain in a user's wallet
as options for any transaction (ie. payment) on a destination chain such as a swap, deposit, mint, transfer, or trade. Trails is architected as a trustless system that
works on top of existing bridging / filler / solver infrastructure. Trails is free to integrate for any app.

## Key Features

### 1-click Seamless Payments
- Payments occur in a single confirmation with any wallet, regardless if it's an EOA, account abstraction wallet, or EIP-7702 enabled.
- Developers simply specify payment intent (e.g., "purchase NFT #123 with 30 USDC") for a user to confirm.
- Built-in multi-chain real-time indexing to automatically return user's wallet balances & prices. No additional vendor license required.

### Universal User Liquidity
- Aggregates all user balances across every token and chain as payment options.
- Enables payments using any combination of available assets and chains, i.e., use 30 USDC from Optimism + Base to purchase NFT for 60 USDC.
- Leveraging existing liquidity infrastructure such as DEX's, bridges, or aggregators, we support a vast array of tokens and chains.

### Blazing Fast
- Fast from anywhere, even with payments across chains using our intent-based architecture & relayer infrastructure. ~15 seconds to execution.
- Protocol intelligently detects optimal route for payment fulfillment.

### Scalable
- Trails can leverage virtually any existing cross-chain or liquidity infrastructure.
- Relayer & Indexing infrastructure is lightweight and easily deployable to new chains.

## How Trails Works

1. **Define Intent (app)**: Create a payment transaction (mint, deposit, swap, etc) for any chain in any token.
2. **Trails Inspects (trails sdk)**: Can this succeed with the assets held on current chain? Yes = Pass through. No = Continue Orchestration
3. **Select Route (user)**: Trails suggests the optimal tokens across chains â€” user can confirm or customize.
4. **Orchestrate Transaction (trails sdk)**: Intelligently combine swap + bridge + execute for the selected route.
5. **Execute Transaction (trails intents)**: User confirms transaction via their wallet which executes the end to end to flow for the selected payment.

This architecture enables developers to build sophisticated transaction experiences while abstracting the underlying complexity of multi-chain operations - all you have to do is specify what transaction to execute
on a destination chain.

The Trails is complementary to existing cross-chain infrastructure by leveraging various fillers & solvers as well as various DEX's and bridges for maximum liquidity across a wide variety of tokens.

Trails supports any wallets including: EOA wallets such as MetaMask, smart wallets like Coinbase Smart Wallet or Sequence. Trails supports any EVM-compatible chain
and does not require EIP-7702 enabled wallets. For more information please read our [architecture section](/architecture/how-it-works).
