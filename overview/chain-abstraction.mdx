## Maximizing Buying Power

User wallet balances are typically fragmented across multiple networks. Not only is this cumbersome from a user experience perspective to manage where funds are held, this also limits the buying power on applications for any given payment as I can only use the funds on a single source chain at any time.

In contrast, AnyPay is a chain-abstracted solution that hides the complexity of multiple blockchains from both developers and end users, creating a unified experience that feels like interacting with a single blockchain with a single, aggregated balance.

## Cross-Chain vs Chain Abstraction

### Traditional Cross-Chain

In traditional cross-chain interactions, users:

- Manage multiple wallets, gas tokens, and bridge separately for a payment
- Understand bridging protocols and wait times
- Handle transaction failures across different chains
- Navigate complex user interfaces for each blockchain

The standard cross-chain experience requires users to be aware of and manage multiple blockchain networks, each with their own tokens, interfaces, and complexities which significantly increases complexity.

### Chain Abstraction

AnyPay is a chain abstraction solution that eliminates these complexities by:

- **Universal Buying Power**: Applications can enable users to pay in every token from every chain for any arbitrary payment, i.e., an NFT costs 60 USDC on Base, a user can purchase it using 30 USDC on Optimism and 30 Arbitrum seamlessly.
- **Unified User Interface**: Single point of interaction across all chains
- **Gasless Transactions**: Users don't need to hold specific gas tokens to interact across chains
- **Failure Recovery**: Built-in mechanisms to handle and recover from failed transactions

With chain abstraction, users interact with a unified layer that automatically handles all the underlying blockchain complexity with simple integration with AnyPay for developers - optimized for payments.


## Unifying the Modular Ecosystem

Chain abstraction through AnyPay realizes the vision of modular blockchain networks, by unifying fragmented liquidity, enhancing buying power for users, and simplifying integration across networks.
